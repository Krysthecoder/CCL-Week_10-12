Nothing new to add, just a brief explanation that NodeJs allows JS to work on OS and not just in browswers

> due to using normal method fs.read(), etc. takes to much time when we work on large files we use something called Streams & buffer

Streams

Start using data, before it has finished loading

Stream is the channel, while the buffers are chunk of datas that loads into our system (instead of waiting an hour for the entire file to download)

## Client & server

client is basically front end, server is the back end side

IP address

> localhost is like a domain on th web but it points out directly to our machine
